# Regression-Regulization

Regularization is a means to reduce overfitting, reducing the degrees of freedom of the model in order to reduce the variance in the model and thereby increasing its ability to generalize.

Lasso implements L1 norm regularization. Lasso takes the absolute value of the weights as a penalty for the loss function.

Ridge implements L2 norm regularization Ridge takes a square of the weights as a penalty for the loss function.

ElasticNet implements a mix of Lasso and Ridge
